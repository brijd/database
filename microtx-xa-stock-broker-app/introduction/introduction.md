# Introduction

## About this Workshop

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to integrate the functionality provided by the Oracle® Transaction Manager for Microservices (MicroTx) client libraries. Use MicroTx client libraries to register the required interceptors and callbacks, to obtain a connection to the application's resource manager, and to delineate transaction boundaries which indicate that an XA transaction has started, and then to commit or roll back the transaction.

Estimated Workshop Time: *1 hours 20 minutes*

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Provide configuration information for the MicroTx library properties for a participant application and initiator application.
* Include the MicroTx client libraries in your application to configure your Java application as a transaction initiator service. A transaction initiator service starts and ends a transaction.
* Include the MicroTx client libraries in your application to configure your Java application as a transaction participant. A transaction participant service only joins the transaction. They do not initiate a transaction.
* Run the sample application which uses the XA transaction protocol.
