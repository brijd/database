# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop offers a deep dive into building intelligent, AI-agentic workflows using MicroTx Workflow, focused on a practical loan application processing use case.

The session introduces a novel architecture where a planner system task, powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), dynamically determines the flow of execution across multiple specialized AI agents (e.g., KYC, credit scoring, risk evaluation), and ensure consistency in financial operations through distributed transactions coordinated by MicroTx. Participants will build this orchestration end-to-end using JSON, Java, MicroTx Workflow Engine, using a modular agent-based design. This session will equip participants with the ability to define, configure, and execute AI-enhanced workflows in real-world scenarios with dynamic control flow, decision-making, and integration.

In this workshop, participants will learn how to create intelligent, AI-agentic workflows using JSON and orchestrated using MicroTx Workflow, with a specific focus on a loan application processing use case. Attendees will use a planner system task, powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), which dynamically determines the execution sequence of multiple agent-based tasks. Upon loan approval, the workflow culminates in a loan disbursement step that is executed as a distributed transaction coordinated by MicroTx, ensuring atomicity and consistency across distributed system boundaries.

By the end of this session, participants will:

* Understand how to model and orchestrate agentic workflows for production-grade use cases

* Learn how to use a planner system task that uses LLMs for real-time decision-making

* Gain hands-on experience in building modular agent workers in Java (e.g., KYC Agent, Credit Agent)

* Explore how AI and orchestration can be combined to improve flexibility, automation, and control in business processes

* Configure and execute distributed transactions with MicroTx

This workshop is ideal for anyone building AI-driven agentic workflows with strict reliability and transactional guarantees in Java-based microservices environments.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour 30 minutes (This estimate is for the entire workshop - it is the sum of the estimates provided for each of the labs included in the workshop.)
